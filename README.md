# Checkpoint: Introduction to Data Structures and Procedural Programming

## Overview
This checkpoint includes two problems that demonstrate the use of arrays, nested loops, and procedural programming in pseudocode.

## Problem 1: Sum of Distinct Elements
- **Description:** Calculate the sum of elements that are present in only one of the two given sets.
- **Pseudocode file:** `problem1_sum_distinct.txt`
- **Techniques:** 
    - Arrays to store sets
    - Nested loops to compare elements
- **Example:**
    ```
    Set1 = [3, 1, 7, 9]
    Set2 = [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]
    Output: 13 (distinct elements 2, 4, 7)
    ```

## Problem 2: Dot Product and Orthogonality
- **Description:** Compute the dot product of two vectors and determine whether they are orthogonal (dot product = 0).
- **Pseudocode file:** `problem2_dot_product.txt`
- **Techniques:**
    - Arrays for vectors
    - Nested loops to compute dot product
    - Procedure to calculate dot product
    - Use of pass-by-reference
- **Example:**
    ```
    v1 = [1, 0, 0], v2 = [0, 1, 0] → orthogonal
    v1 = [1, 2, 3], v2 = [4, 5, 6] → not orthogonal
    ```
